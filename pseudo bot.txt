    let candidates be an array of all possible settlement locations

    ALGORITHM
    resources_wanted = ['wood', 'clay', 'wheat', 'sheep' 'ore']
    s1 = random from candidates
    local_resources = resources in tiles adjacent to settlement

    place settlement at s1
    remove s1 from candidates
    remove adjacent settlements from candidates

    place road in random direction from settlement

    remove all local_resources from resources

    // Now time for the second settlement
    // Go through every settlement left: if we find one that gives us access to the remaining resources, take it!
    // if this leaves us with only one left, the bot is stuck with that one

        if all resources_wanted in local_resources:
            break and return

    place settlement at s2
    place road in random direction from settlement

EACH TURN
    do something random idk
