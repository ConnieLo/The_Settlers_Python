class TEXTBOX
    for now this class only needs very basic functionality:
    - Should be initialised with text as a field
    - text field should be able to be changed dynamically
    - separate method for drawing the textbox
    for the first prototype, we do not need anything in the way of size/font customisation, set some sensible defaults
    for these, and we can work on customising them later if we need to

    PUBLIC METHODS/FIELDS
    param surface:  A Pygame surface object on which the text is to appear
    param co-ordinates: A Pygame Rect object
    method draw(surface, co-ordinates)
