1.  make trading work, have a look at the class "Trade" and see if it is in anyway useful
2.  create a draw() for blitting 2 cards; the largest army and longest road, and hopefully assigning appropriately to that player
3.  start looking on implementation of AI bots, just take random steps

If you have time:
1.  change the images for the bots to prettier images
2.  write the steps that the user has to take on the UI, e.g., 1. first place a settlement
                                                               2. place a road
                                                               3. roll the dice
                                                               4. click on end turn button,
                                                               5. etc...
